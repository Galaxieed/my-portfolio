# My Portfolio
This project was purely done by plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the purpose of refreshing and to train my knowledge on web development fundamentals.
This does not count as my main portfolio since this is for practice purposes only. However, the details here are correct. 
Though the other projects mentioned inside may not show any preview in it since I failed to keep a copy of them even in a physical storage.
